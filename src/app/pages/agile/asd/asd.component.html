            <h3>Why</h3>
            <p>There is a need for flexibility and adaptability in software development to handle dynamic requirements and ensure that the final product meets user expectations.</p>
            <h3>What</h3>
            <p>Adaptive Software Development focuses on continuous adaptation and learning. It includes three main phases: Speculate, Collaborate, and Learn. These phases help manage uncertainty and drive the project towards successful outcomes.</p>
            <h3>How</h3>
            <p>Implementing ASD involves initial planning (Speculate), collaborative development (Collaborate), and iterative learning (Learn). Teams use practices like pair programming, code reviews, and daily stand-ups to ensure alignment and continuous improvement.</p>
            <h3>What if</h3>
            <p>ASD can be adapted for various environments and challenges, such as integrating with other agile methodologies like Scrum or Kanban. It can also be tailored to fit the specific needs of different projects or organizational structures.</p>

            <h3>Forms</h3>
            <p>Forms are used for managing changes, planning iterations, and continuous evaluation. They help track progress and ensure that all stakeholders are aligned.</p>
            <h3>Dynamic Model</h3>
            <p>The dynamic model includes process diagrams to integrate ASD into an existing agile workflow. These diagrams help visualize the process and make it easier to manage and adapt.</p>
