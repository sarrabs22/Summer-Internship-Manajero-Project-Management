            <div class="text-section">
              <p>
                <strong>Origins:</strong> Adaptive Software Development (ASD) emerged in the mid-1990s as an innovative response to the rigidity and limitations of traditional methodologies like the Waterfall model. Developed by Jim Highsmith, ASD is rooted in collaboration, learning, and adaptationâ€”cornerstones for thriving in dynamic environments.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Methodology:</strong> Unlike traditional methods that rely on upfront planning and linear project execution, ASD advocates for a flexible and iterative approach characterized by a cycle of speculation, collaboration, and learning. This flexibility helps teams quickly adapt to changing requirements, which is crucial in projects influenced by market and technological shifts.

            <div class="text-section">
              <p>
                <strong>Impact:</strong> By integrating regular feedback loops and encouraging ongoing reassessment of project directions, ASD enables organizations to align software development more closely with user needs and current market conditions. It empowers teams to experiment, innovate, and learn from failures without the constraints of a fixed plan.
